Key Features and Achievements:

Data Integration and Modeling: I began by extracting and transforming raw call center data from various sources into a structured and unified format using Power Query. Leveraging DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), I created calculated columns and measures that captured important KPIs such as Average Call Handling Time, First Call Resolution Rate, Call Volume, and Customer Satisfaction Index.

Interactive Visualizations: The dashboard boasts a variety of interactive visualizations, including line charts, bar graphs, pie charts, and tables. These visualizations allow users to explore data trends over time, compare agent performance, and identify peak call hours.

Agent Performance Analysis: A dedicated section of the dashboard offers insights into individual agent performance. Managers can evaluate key metrics like Call Resolution Rate, Average Handle Time, and Customer Feedback scores for each agent. This feature facilitates targeted coaching and performance improvement initiatives.

User-Friendly Interface: The dashboard's user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, enabling easy navigation and exploration of the data. Users can apply filters and slicers to customize their views and extract meaningful insights.

Business Impact:

The completion of this project contributes significantly to enhancing call center operations at PwC Switzerland. The Power BI dashboard equips decision-makers with a holistic view of call center performance, enabling proactive measures to improve agent efficiency, optimize call handling processes, and elevate customer experiences.

I am immensely proud of the outcomes achieved through this project and the skills I've developed in data integration, modeling, and visualization using Power BI.
